	  code.

Mon Jul 31 07:01:42 2000 Ken Pizzini <ken@gnu.org>

	* dc/numeric.c: use of the "n" command can cause a number to be printed
	  without a trailing newline, which would cause the column counter to
	  fail to be reset and result in inappropriately wrapped numeric outputs.
	  Fixed by always clearing the column counter before outputting each number.

	* dc/stack.c: if a stack is used without ever using the correspondingly
	  named register, it is perfectly legitimate for the register to be
	  uninitialized; added an "else if" to handle this case without aborting.

Sun Mar  8 21:13:50 1998  Phil Nelson  <phil@cs.wwu.edu>

	* bc/main.c: Applied patch from Ken Pizzini to force line
	  mode buffering on stdout.

Tue Jan  6 09:15:04 PST 1998  Ken Pizzini <ken@halcyon.com>

	* h/version.h: dc is now up to version 1.1.5.

	* dc/eval.c, dc/numeric.c, doc/dc.texi, doc/dc.1: once again
	  changed the behavior of the 'P' command with a numeric argument
	  to make it more general.  It now dumps out the *whole* number
	  (or rather, the whole of its positive integer portion) as a
	  byte stream.  (For small values this is still the same as 'aP'.)

	* dc/dc-proto.h, dc/dc.h, dc/eval.c, dc/misc.c, dc/numeric.c,
	  dc/stack.c, dc/string.c: Changed most uses of dc_boolean to
	  either dc_discard or dc_newline, and instances of DC_TRUE and
	  DC_FALSE to appropriate instances of DC_TOSS, DC_KEEP, DC_NONL,
	  or DC_WITHNL so that the code self-documents a little better.

Sun Jan  4 15:39:46 PST 1998  Ken Pizzini <ken@halcyon.com>

	* dc/eval.c, doc/dc.texi, doc/dc.1: Changed the functionality
	  of the 'P' command, and added the 'n' command.  Due to
	  a quirk of the implementation of traditional dc, some
	  people have come to expect that the 'P' command on a
	  numeric argument in the range of 1 to 99 should output
	  the corresponding character, despite the fact that this
	  usage can have very weird results for numbers outside
	  that range.  This functionality is why the 'a' command
	  was introduced last March, but people really want it to
	  "just work" without needing to use the 'a' command.
	  Bowing to this demand, the 'P' command now does the
	  equivalent of "aP" if the argument is numeric, and the
	  'n' command has been added to support the previous
	  functionality of the 'P' command.

	* dc/misc.c, dc/eval.c, dc/stack.c, dc/dc-proto.h:
	  Changed prototype for dc_print().  It now additionally
	  takes two flags, newline_p and discard_p, which it
	  passes through to dc_out_num() and dc_out_str() as
	  needed.

	* h/version.h: dc is now up to version 1.1.4.

Sat Sep 27 13:48:53 1997  Ken Pizzini <ken@halcyon.com>

	* h/version.h: dc is now up to version 1.1.3.

	* dc/stack.c, dc/array.c, dc/dc-proto.h, doc/dc.texi, doc/dc.1:
	  It has come to my attention that, though undocumented,
	  traditional dc stacked its arrays in parallel with the
	  stacking of simple registers.  I have now duplicated
	  this functionality.

	* dc/dc.c, configure.in: line-buffer dc's output if setvbuf()
	  is supported.  This was requested to simplify using dc as
	  an inferior process under emacs.

Fri Sep 26 19:56:15 1997  Ken Pizzini <ken@halcyon.com>

	* dc/dc.c: fixed bug reporting address for --help.

	* doc/dc.1, doc/dc.texi: corrected documentation of the maximum
	  admissible input base.

	* doc/dc.texi: corrected sample code equivalence for the | command.

	* lib/number.c: added a warning for non-zero scale in the base
	  for bc_raisemod().

Fri Sep 26 18:15:31 1997  Ken Pizzini <ken@halcyon.com>

	* dc/eval.c, doc/dc.1, doc/dc.texi: added !=, !<, and !> commands.

Tue Jul  7 21:09:07 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* (const.h, bc.y, util.c) Added code so that when the math
	  library is loaded, redefinition of any math library function
	  will not cause the other functions to quit working correctly.
	  Before this change, redefining a(x) would cause s(x) and c(x)
	  to quit working and redefining s(x) would cause c(x) to quit
	  working.

Wed Jul  1 14:35:29 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* (libmath.b) Changed the calculation of scale for computing

	  same as the variable "last".  This is not a "standard" feature,
	  but is provided for those who want it.

	* (Install) Documented the new define for dot (.).

	* (bc.1) Documented the use of dot (.) for "last".

	* (Makefile) Added an easy method for adding extra defines for
	  use during the compile.  Set DOT_IS_LAST as a standard
	  extra define.

	* (number.c) Changed the code for sqrt for better speed.

Mon Jun 22 21:47:05 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* Changed the name of math.h to libmath.h to avoid conflict
	  with /usr/include/math.h.  Changed all references to math.h
	  to libmath.h in all files.

	* (configure) Changed the test for long strings accepted by
	  cc to not include libmath.h and thus not need to distribute
	  a file that is generated by the system.

	* (Makefile) Changed PREFIX, BINDIR, LIBDIR, and MANDIR to
	  lower case.

Tue Mar  3 10:16:07 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	  caused some problems with interrupted programs.

Thu Jan 16 17:08:16 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* (Makefile) Changed install to install the manual.

Wed Jan  8 13:23:42 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* Change all copyright notices to include 1992.
	
	* (load.c) Added termination to "load_code" to ignore code
	  after an error has been found.

	* (scan.l) Changed the check for NUL characters in STRING tokens
	  (before the close quote) to work correctly.  Also added code to
	  report illegal characters in a more readable output format.

	* (bc.1) Added the exclusion of NUL characters from strings in
	  the "differences" section and updated date of last change.

	* (const.h) Changed BC_MAX_SEGS to 16.

Mon Jan  6 14:20:02 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* (number.c) Changed the out_num routine to use a correct field
	  size for bases greater than 16.  e.g.  For base 1000, each
	  "digit" is a three digit number.

	* (Makefile) Added the "8" flag to get an 8 bit scanner.

	* (scan.l) Changed "char *" to "unsigned char *" to match the
	  declaration of yytext for the 8 bit scanner.  Also added code
	  to detect the null character in strings and generate an error.

Sat Jan  4 20:32:20 1992  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* (const.h) Changed BC_BASE_MAX to INT_MAX to allow more bases!
